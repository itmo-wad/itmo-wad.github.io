# Homework #3

Reading → Coding → Deploy → Code-review

## Introduction

After homework 2, you have a website where users can login to see profile page. Now let’s implement a real useful thing - a personal (or multi-user) blog website.

## Instruction
### Basic part
Implement blog website features:
1. A public "Story" page where everyone can see all blog posts
2. Only authenticated user can add new post

### Advanced part
1. Post can have a theme image (and author name if your app is multi-user)
2. Add visibility of the post (public/private) so guest can see only public posts (authenticated user can see his/her own private/public posts)
3. Deploy your app using docker-compose (docker-compose.yaml will be evaluated)

### Challenging part
1. Implement editing and deleting post feature
2. "Story" page automatically check and update for new posts

## Deploy & Submission
1. Describe what you implemented in README.md
2. Upload the code to a separate GitHub repository (https://github.com/itmo-wad/username-hw3)
3. Submit the link to your work to Google Classroom assignment

## Code-review

1. Communicate in Telegram chat
2. Help others to complete the assignment
