## Introduction

In this home work, you will build a static profile page which provides an overview about yourself and serve it as a website using Python Flask. Before that, you will need to do some small but very useful tasks with Github.

## Instruction

1. Register a GitHub account
2. Fill link to the account in Google Doc. Join itmo-wad GitHub organization
3. Create your GitHub profile (if you have nothing against it)
4. Frontend: create a static profile page about yourself (HTML + CSS)

        Profile page should have: heading, text, image, etc.
        You can choose any design of profile page that you like
5. Backend: using Python Flask to serve the frontend (profile page)
        
    1. Basic part:
        
        * Serve static profile page at default route ('/') (using any method you want)
        * Serve images, CSS files as static resources

    2. Advanced part:
        * Serve profile page using render_template (might be with parameters on your choice)
        * Serve profile page at '/profile' and redirect default route to it

6. README.md file:
        
    Short description about what have been done

7. Make Github page for your frontend part (with your own repository, not in itmo-wad organization)


8. After your account added to itmo-wad organization, create a new repository and upload your home to that repository.

9. Submit link to that repository to Google Classroom assignment.
