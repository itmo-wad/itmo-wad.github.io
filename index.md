3. _if you don't know about git_ read this article (https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/resources/git-and-github-a-beginners-guide-for-complete-newbies)

## Coding

### Basic part
1. Create static website for image gallery with HTML + CSS
2. You are allowed to use any JS or CSS frameworks
3. Website consists of header and body with equal sized square images
4. Screen resolution is 1980x1200, you can optionally try to make it responsive

### Optimal part
5. Make 1px white border for hovered image (when cursor pointer is over the image)
6. When image is on hover, it reveals caption
7. Image on hover should be shadowed with 60%

### Challenging part
8. After click, there should appear modal window with text
